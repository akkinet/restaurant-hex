# React Restaurant Website

Welcome to the React Restaurant Website project! 

This project is a part of my learning journey with React, where I will be building a restaurant website based on a Figma design. 

The project will be updated daily until completion.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code for a restaurant website built using React. 

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional and visually appealing website for a restaurant, showcasing various sections such as the menu, about us, contact information, and more.

## Live Updates

I will be updating this repository regularly as I progress with the development of the website.

Each update will include new features, improvements, and fixes based on the project requirements and design specifications.

## Design

The website design is based on a Figma prototype, which provides a visual guideline for the layout, color scheme, typography, and overall aesthetics.
